# Storybook Design System Orchestration

This directory contains the **Architect Crew methodology** implementation for automated documentation generation in the React Design System project. It orchestrates the complete documentation chain: **RDS → CLAUDE → AGENTS → FRS**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Architect Crew methodology creates a complete automation chain for design system documentation:

```mermaid

    A[docs/RDS.md] --> B[CLAUDE.md]
    B --> C[AGENTS.md]
    C --> D[docs/FRS.md]
    D --> E[Implementation]
    
    subgraph "Generation Scripts"
        F[generate-claude.js]
        G[generate-agents.js]
        H[generate-frs.js]
    end

    C --> H
    
    subgraph "Templates"
        I[CLAUDE.template.md]
        J[AGENTS.template.md]
        K[FRS.template.md]
    end
    
    F --> I
    G --> J
    H --> K
```

## Stakeholders & Personas

This design system is built to serve multiple personas across the development and design lifecycle. Each persona has specific needs and requirements that drive the system's architecture and features:

### Primary Stakeholders

- **Product Owner** - Voice of the customer, articulating priorities and customer pain points
- **Brand Manager** - Voice of the brand, ensuring consistent brand identity and visual representation
- **Copywriter** - Voice of tone and messaging, maintaining consistent brand voice across all content
- **Frontend Developers** - Building consistent, reusable components with TypeScript support
- **UI/UX Designers** - Ensuring design-to-code consistency and accessibility compliance
- **Product Managers** - Driving brand consistency and faster feature delivery
- **QA Engineers** - Implementing automated testing and quality assurance
- **DevOps Engineers** - Managing CI/CD pipelines and deployment infrastructure

For detailed persona requirements and specifications, see the individual persona files in the `docs/` directory.

## Architect Crew Methodology & Documentation Structure

This repository employs the **Architect Crew methodology** to manage requirements, technical design, and AI collaboration:

-   **`docs/RDS.md` (Requirements Document Specification):** This document outlines the **functional requirements** of the design system. It answers *what* the system should do and *why*, based on user personas and business needs. It is the source of truth for functional goals.
-   **`docs/FRS.md` (Functional Requirements Specification):** This document provides the **detailed technical specifications**. It answers *how* the system should be built, including all UML diagrams (using Mermaid), component architecture, API contracts, and other specific implementation blueprints. It is the authoritative source for all technical design.
-   **`CLAUDE.md` (AI Architect Instructions):** This file guides the "Architect AI" (e.g., Claude) in its role. Its primary responsibilities include translating functional requirements from `docs/RDS.md` into detailed technical specifications in `docs/FRS.md`, and ensuring that `AGENTS.md` is correctly aligned to guide implementing AIs.
-   **`AGENTS.md` (AI Agent Constitution):** This document provides direct, actionable instructions for AI agents performing implementation tasks. Crucially, it mandates that agents **MUST** refer to `docs/FRS.md` for all technical details and specifications when implementing features or components. *(Note: Due to technical issues during a recent update, AGENTS.md may not fully reflect this yet. The intention is for it to strictly enforce FRS.md adherence.)*

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns: functional requirements are distinct from technical specifications, and AI roles are clearly defined to maintain architectural integrity and accurate documentation.

### 🤖 Automated Generation Chain

This repository now includes **automated generation capabilities** that maintain the Architect Crew methodology through code:

#### Generation Flow: RDS → CLAUDE → AGENTS → FRS

1. **RDS → CLAUDE (Architecture Generation)**
   - **Trigger**: Changes to `docs/RDS.md` or `docs/persona-*.md`
   - **Process**: Analyzes requirements and personas to generate architectural decisions
   - **Output**: `CLAUDE.md` with complete system architecture
   - **Script**: `scripts/generate-claude.js`
   - **Template**: `templates/CLAUDE.template.md`

2. **CLAUDE → AGENTS (Implementation Instructions)**
   - **Trigger**: Changes to `CLAUDE.md`
   - **Process**: Translates architecture into specific implementation instructions
   - **Output**: `AGENTS.md` with detailed implementation guidance
   - **Script**: `scripts/generate-agents.js`
   - **Template**: `templates/AGENTS.template.md`

3. **AGENTS → FRS (Technical Documentation)**
   - **Trigger**: Changes to `AGENTS.md` or implementation files
   - **Process**: Analyzes actual implementation and documents technical specifications
   - **Output**: `docs/FRS.md` with complete technical documentation
   - **Script**: `scripts/generate-frs.js`
   - **Template**: `templates/FRS.template.md`

#### Automated Workflows

- **`generate-docs.yml`**: Automatically detects changes and regenerates appropriate documents
- **`manual-generate.yml`**: Allows manual triggering of generation for specific documents
- **Quality Gates**: Validates content, UTF-8 encoding, and required sections

#### Generation Commands

```bash
# Generate entire documentation chain
npm run generate:all

# Generate specific documents
npm run generate:claude    # RDS → CLAUDE
npm run generate:agents    # CLAUDE → AGENTS  
npm run generate:frs       # AGENTS → FRS

# Preview mode (no file changes)
npm run generate:claude:dry-run
npm run generate:agents:dry-run
npm run generate:frs:dry-run

# Force regeneration (ignore timestamps)
npm run generate:all:force
```

This automation ensures that the Architect Crew methodology is consistently applied and that all documentation remains synchronized as the project evolves.

## BDD Requirements Flow

The design system follows a structured Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach. Functional requirements originate from `docs/RDS.md` and are then translated into detailed technical designs in `docs/FRS.md`. These technical designs then inform the BDD process:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RDS : Requirements Document Specification
    
    RDS --> Features : Articulate Features
    Features --> Scenarios : Break down into Scenarios
    
    state Features {
        [*] --> FeatureDefinition
        FeatureDefinition --> FeatureDescription
        FeatureDescription --> [*]
    }
    
    state Scenarios {
        [*] --> ScenarioIdentification
        ScenarioIdentification --> AcceptanceCriteria
        AcceptanceCriteria --> GherkinNotation
        GherkinNotation --> [*]
    }
    
    Scenarios --> UserStories : Each Scenario becomes User Story
    
    state UserStories {
        [*] --> StoryNaming
        StoryNaming --> StoryDescription
        StoryDescription --> BDDFormat
        BDDFormat --> StoryAcceptanceCriteria
        
        note right of BDDFormat : As a {persona}\nI want to {action}\nSo that {outcome}
        note right of StoryAcceptanceCriteria : Gherkin notation:\nGiven/When/Then
    }
    
    UserStories --> TestCases : Acceptance Criteria → Test Cases
    
    state TestCases {
        [*] --> UnitTests
        [*] --> IntegrationTests
        [*] --> E2ETests
        [*] --> AccessibilityTests
        
        UnitTests --> TestExecution
        IntegrationTests --> TestExecution
        E2ETests --> TestExecution
        AccessibilityTests --> TestExecution
        
        TestExecution --> [*]
    }
    
    TestCases --> Implementation : Drive Component Development
    Implementation --> Validation : Verify against Acceptance Criteria
    Validation --> [*] : Requirements Satisfied
    
    note left of RDS : Central source of truth\nfor all requirements
    note right of TestCases : Executable specifications\nderived from Gherkin
```

### BDD Methodology Implementation

1.  **`docs/RDS.md` (Requirements Document Specification)**: Central source of truth defining all **functional system requirements**.
2.  **`docs/FRS.md` (Functional Requirements Specification)**: Detailed **technical specifications** derived from RDS, including UML diagrams, API designs, and component architecture. This is the blueprint for implementation.
3.  **Features**: High-level capabilities articulated from RDS requirements and FRS technical designs.
4.  **Scenarios**: Specific situations broken down from each feature.
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Gherkin notation (Given/When/Then) defining scenario success conditions
5. **User Stories**: Each scenario converted to user story format with BDD structure
6. **Test Cases**: Executable tests derived directly from acceptance criteria
7. **Implementation**: Component development driven by test cases
8. **Validation**: Verification that implementation satisfies original acceptance criteria

This approach ensures traceability from high-level requirements through to implementation and testing, maintaining alignment with stakeholder needs throughout the development process.
