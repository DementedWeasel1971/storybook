# CLAUDE.md - Google Maps API MCP Service Architecture Definition & AI Collaboration Guide

**Version**: {{claudeVersion}}  
**Date**: {{date}}  
**Generated from**: RDS.md requirements analysis  
**Technology Stack**: Google Maps API + Model Context Protocol + Node.js/TypeScript

This file defines the comprehensive architecture of the Google Maps API MCP service solution. It aligns with the Architect Crew methodology, where:
- **`docs/RDS.md`** outlines the **functional requirements** and user needs.
- **`docs/FRS.md`** provides the **detailed technical specifications**, including all UML diagrams (Mermaid) and specific implementation blueprints.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (this file) instructs Claude (and similar AI) on how to interpret these documents, contribute to the architecture, and ensure `AGENTS.md` is correctly aligned.
- **`AGENTS.md`** provides specific, actionable instructions for AI agents performing implementation tasks.

## 1. From RDS → FRS Validation

**Source**: `docs/RDS.md` (What & Why)  
**Ensure**: Every RDS requirement appears in FRS diagrams/contracts.
