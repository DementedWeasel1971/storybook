# CLAUDE.md - Design System Architecture Definition & AI Collaboration Guide

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Generated from**: RDS.md requirements analysis

This file defines the comprehensive architecture of the React Design System solution. It aligns with the Architect Crew methodology, where:
- **`docs/RDS.md`** outlines the **functional requirements** and user needs.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (this file) interprets requirements and designs the architecture, ensuring AGENTS.md receives proper implementation guidance.
- **`AGENTS.md`** provides specific, actionable instructions for AI agents performing implementation tasks based on this architectural guidance.
- **`docs/FRS.md`** captures the **detailed technical specifications** that emerge from the implementation process.

## 1. Requirements Analysis & Architectural Interpretation

**Source**: `docs/RDS.md` (What & Why)  
**Architectural Response**: Translate functional requirements into technical architecture

Based on the five key personas identified in RDS.md (Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer, Product Manager, QA Engineer, and DevOps Engineer), this architecture prioritizes:

1. **Developer Experience**: TypeScript-first development with comprehensive type definitions
2. **Design Consistency**: Token-driven design system with semantic naming
3. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in accessibility and testing frameworks
4. **Performance**: Tree-shaking, lazy loading, and bundle optimization
5. **Scalability**: Modular architecture supporting cross-team collaboration

### Persona-Driven Architecture Decisions

**Frontend Developer (Sarah Chen)** needs drive:
- Component-first architecture with atomic design principles
- TypeScript interfaces for all components and design tokens
- Comprehensive Storybook documentation with interactive examples
- Hot module replacement for rapid development iteration

**UI/UX Designer (Marcus Rodriguez)** needs drive:
- Design token abstraction layer for consistent theming
- Visual regression testing integration
- Design-to-code workflow optimization
- Real-time design system documentation

**Product Manager (Jennifer Liu)** needs drive:
- Adoption metrics and usage analytics
- Component lifecycle management
- Cross-platform consistency validation
- Documentation accessibility for non-technical stakeholders

## 2. System Architecture Design

The React Design System follows a layered, persona-driven architecture that ensures scalability, maintainability, and developer experience. The architecture serves as a single source of truth for UI consistency across applications while providing the flexibility needed for diverse use cases.

### Foundation Layer Architecture

**Design Tokens**: The foundational layer consists of semantic design tokens that abstract visual design decisions:
- Color system with semantic naming (primary, secondary, success, warning, danger)
- Typography scale with consistent font families, sizes, and weights  
- Spacing system based on 4px grid (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Border radius and shadow tokens for visual depth

**Theme Provider**: React Context-based theming system that supports:
- Light and dark mode variants
- Runtime theme switching
- Custom brand theme injection
- CSS custom properties for browser compatibility

### Component Architecture Strategy

**Atomic Design Methodology**: Components are organized in a hierarchical structure:
- **Tokens**: Design decisions (colors, spacing, typography)
- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Icon)
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations (SearchBox, FormField)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (Header, Sidebar, DataTable)
- **Templates**: Page-level layout components

**Composition Patterns**: All components follow consistent patterns:
- Polymorphic component APIs using `as` prop for semantic flexibility
- Compound component patterns for complex UI structures
- Render prop patterns for customizable behavior
- Forward ref patterns for DOM access and animation libraries

### Integration Architecture

**Framework Agnostic Core**: While built for React, the design system maintains separation of concerns:
- Design tokens exported as JSON, CSS custom properties, and JavaScript objects
- Component logic separated from styling implementation  
- Platform-specific adapters for React Native and other frameworks
- Build-time optimizations for different deployment targets

## 3. Development Methodology Specification

This architecture requires specific development approaches that will be codified in AGENTS.md:

### Component Development Standards

**TypeScript-First Development**: All components must be developed with TypeScript to ensure type safety and improved developer experience:
- Interface definitions for all props with comprehensive JSDoc
- Generic type support for polymorphic components
- Strict TypeScript configuration with no implicit any
- Type-only imports for performance optimization

**Accessibility-First Approach**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built into component architecture:
- Semantic HTML foundation for all components
- ARIA attributes integrated into component APIs
- Keyboard navigation patterns as first-class citizens
- Screen reader optimization with proper labeling

**Testing Strategy**: Multi-layered testing approach ensuring component reliability:
- Unit tests for component logic and API contracts
- Integration tests for compound component interactions
- Visual regression tests for design consistency
- Accessibility tests using automated tools (axe-core)
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Quality Assurance Framework

**Code Quality Gates**: Automated quality enforcement at multiple levels:
- Pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting
- TypeScript compilation validation
- Test coverage thresholds (minimum 90%)
- Bundle size monitoring and reporting
- Performance budget enforcement

**Documentation Standards**: Living documentation ensuring adoption success:
- Storybook stories for all component variants
- MDX documentation with usage examples
- API documentation auto-generated from TypeScript
- Design guidelines with visual examples
- Migration guides for breaking changes

## 4. Technology Stack Architecture

- CommonJS for legacy compatibility  
- UMD builds for script tag usage
- CSS stylesheets for framework-agnostic usage
- Design token artifacts (JSON, CSS, SCSS)
- **Shadows**: Elevation system for depth and hierarchy

### Component Layer 
- **Primitives** (atoms): Button, Input, Icon, Text, Badge
- **Compositions** (molecules): Card, FormField, Alert, Toast, Modal
- **Complex** (organisms): Table, Navigation, Form, Dashboard
- **Layouts**: Grid, Stack, Container, Sidebar
- **Patterns**: SearchBar, DataTable, FileUpload, Pagination

### Build & Distribution Layer
