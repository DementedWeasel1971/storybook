# CLAUDE.md - Design System Architecture Definition & AI Collaboration Guide

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Generated from**: AGENTS.md template

This file defines the comprehensive architecture of the React Design System solution. It aligns with the Architect Crew methodology, where:
- **`docs/RDS.md`** outlines the **functional requirements** and user needs.
- **`docs/FRS.md`** provides the **detailed technical specifications**, including all UML diagrams (Mermaid) and specific implementation blueprints.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (this file) instructs Claude (and similar AI) on how to interpret these documents, contribute to the architecture, and ensure `AGENTS.md` is correctly aligned.
- **`AGENTS.md`** provides specific, actionable instructions for AI agents performing implementation tasks.

## 1. From RDS → FRS Validation

**Source**: `docs/RDS.md` (What & Why)  
**Ensure**: Every RDS requirement appears in FRS diagrams/contracts.

The current implementation validates requirements traceability between RDS functional requirements and FRS technical specifications. All persona-driven requirements from RDS.md have corresponding technical solutions documented in FRS.md.

## 2. Architectural Overview

This architecture is designed to address the specific pain points of five key personas. Persona analysis can be found in the `docs/` directory.

The React Design System follows a layered, persona-driven architecture that ensures scalability, maintainability, and developer experience. The architecture serves as a single source of truth for UI consistency across applications while providing the flexibility needed for diverse use cases.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- Component-driven development with atomic design principles
- Design token-based styling for consistency
- Accessibility-first approach (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- TypeScript-first development for type safety
- Automated testing and quality assurance
- Performance optimization through tree-shaking and lazy loading

## 3. Component & Module Breakdown

The design system follows a layered architecture approach:

### Foundation Layer (Design Tokens)
- **Colors**: Semantic color palette with light/dark mode support
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- **Typography**: Type scale with font families, sizes, and weights
- **Borders**: Radius and width tokens for consistent component styling
- **Shadows**: Elevation system for depth and hierarchy

### Component Layer 
- **Primitives** (atoms): Button, Input, Icon, Text, Badge
- **Compositions** (molecules): Card, FormField, Alert, Toast, Modal
- **Complex** (organisms): Table, Navigation, Form, Dashboard
- **Layouts**: Grid, Stack, Container, Sidebar
- **Patterns**: SearchBar, DataTable, FileUpload, Pagination

### Build & Distribution Layer
- **Vite**: Development server with hot module replacement
- **Rollup**: Library bundling for distribution
- **TypeScript**: Type checking and compilation
- **Storybook**: Component development and documentation
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation

## 4. Persona-Driven Principles

This architecture is designed around five key user personas:

1. **Frontend Developer**: Needs predictable APIs, TypeScript support, and comprehensive documentation
2. **UI/UX Designer**: Requires design token integration, visual consistency, and design-to-code alignment
3. **Product Manager**: Focuses on business value, development efficiency, and scalability metrics
4. **QA Engineer**: Emphasizes automated testing, accessibility compliance, and quality gates
5. **DevOps Engineer**: Concentrates on deployment automation, performance monitoring, and infrastructure

### Developer-Centric Component Architecture
- Type-first component design with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Predictable prop patterns across all components
- Tree-shakable exports for optimal bundle sizes
- Zero-config integration with existing React applications
- Comprehensive documentation with usage examples

### Design-Implementation Bridge Architecture  
- Design tokens as single source of truth for visual consistency
- Storybook as living style guide and component playground
- Automated design-to-code synchronization
- Visual regression testing for design consistency
- Component state mapping between design tools and implementation

### Business Value Architecture
- Metrics-driven development with adoption tracking
- ROI measurement through development efficiency gains
- Scalable component library supporting 100+ components
- Cost savings through code reuse and consistency
- Time-to-market acceleration through pre-built components

### Quality Assurance Architecture
- Test-driven component development with 90%+ coverage
- Automated accessibility testing with axe-core integration
- Visual regression testing via Chromatic
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Infrastructure and Deployment Architecture
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with semantic versioning
- Multi-environment deployment strategy
- CDN distribution for optimal performance
- Real-time monitoring and error tracking
- Rollback capabilities for deployment safety

2. **Methodological Rigor**: Use isolated development environments and proper testing
3. **Evidence-Based Performance**: All performance claims must be backed by measurements
4. **Dependency Management**: Careful evaluation of new dependencies and technologies
5. **Security First**: Integral security considerations in architectural design
6. **Documentation Integrity**: Maintain CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md alignment
7. **Technical Merit**: Justify all architectural decisions with clear reasoning

---

**Prime Directive**: Always ensure components are accessible, reusable, and follow design system principles as defined in `docs/FRS.md`. Every component must work seamlessly across different applications and maintain consistency with established design tokens and patterns.
