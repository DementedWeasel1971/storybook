# Requirements Document Specification (RDS)
## React Design System Project

### Project Overview
This document defines the requirements for a comprehensive React-based Design System that addresses the needs of multiple personas across the development and design lifecycle. The system provides reusable components, design tokens, and documentation to ensure scalable UI consistency.

### Change Management, Security, and Governance Requirements

These requirements aggregate insights from the persona files and additional repository documentation. They ensure that Storybook remains the single source for interactive documentation while maintaining strict control over how changes are introduced and validated.

#### Governance and Audit
- Automated audit trails recording who changed each component and when
- Approval workflows enforced through an MCP server for high–risk changes
- Risk assessment and mitigation steps captured before merge
- Regulatory compliance checks integrated with Storybook builds

#### Security Controls
- Continuous security scanning of components and dependencies
- Secure development workflow with mandatory security checkpoints
- Dependency risk management with automated alerts
- Version rollback strategy for rapid mitigation of security issues

#### Change & Version Management
- Git-based source control with branch protection rules
- Semantic versioning for both component library and Storybook site
- Automated CI/CD pipeline publishing Storybook and npm packages
- MCP server gates releases and maintains change history

    Approve --> Version[Semantic Version Tag]
    Version --> Deploy[Deploy Storybook]

```

These governance and security practices keep the design system reliable while allowing the Storybook documentation to evolve safely over time.
