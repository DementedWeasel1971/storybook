    loadTime: 'monitor initial load performance';
    errorRate: 'track component error rates';
    usageStats: 'monitor component adoption';
  };
  
  alerts: {
    buildFailure: 'immediate notification';
    performanceDegradation: '5 minute threshold';
    securityVulnerability: 'immediate notification';
    uptimeIssues: '1 minute threshold';
  };
  
  dashboards: {
    systemHealth: 'real-time system status';
    usageAnalytics: 'component usage trends';
    performanceMetrics: 'system performance data';
    deploymentStatus: 'release pipeline status';
  };
}
```

#### Log Management

```yaml
# Centralized logging configuration
logging:
  aggregation: 'ELK Stack'
  retention: '90 days'

### Disaster Recovery

#### Backup and Recovery Strategy

1. **Code Repository**: Git-based version control with multiple remotes
2. **NPM Package**: Version-controlled package registry with rollback capability
3. **Documentation Site**: Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
4. **Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code with version control

#### Incident Response

1. **Automated Detection**: Monitoring systems detect issues automatically
2. **Alert Escalation**: Tiered alert system for different severity levels
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Automated rollback for critical issues
4. **Post-Incident Review**: Systematic analysis and improvement process

This persona drives the infrastructure and deployment architecture decisions, ensuring the design system is reliably delivered and maintained in production environments.
