### User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

#### Epic: Design System Governance and Compliance

**Story 1: Comprehensive Audit Trail System**
- **As an** Internal Auditor ensuring governance compliance
- **I want** complete audit trails for all design system changes and decisions
- **So that** I can demonstrate proper governance during compliance audits

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Feature: Design System Audit Trail
  Scenario: Component change audit trail
    Given a developer makes changes to a component
    When the change is submitted through the design system
    Then the system records the change author, timestamp, and rationale
    And approval workflows are automatically triggered
    And complete audit trail is maintained for compliance review
    And unauthorized changes are prevented and logged
```

**Story 2: Automated Governance Compliance Monitoring**
- **As an** Internal Auditor monitoring governance adherence
- **I want** real-time monitoring of governance compliance across all design system activities
- **So that** governance violations are identified and addressed immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Feature: Governance Compliance Monitoring
  Scenario: Real-time governance validation
    Given design system activities are occurring
    When governance policies are defined in the system
    Then all activities are automatically validated against policies
    And non-compliant activities are flagged and blocked
    And compliance reports are generated automatically
```

**Story 3: Risk Assessment Integration**
- **As an** Internal Auditor managing operational risks
- **I want** integrated risk assessment for all component changes
- **So that** high-risk changes are properly evaluated and mitigated
