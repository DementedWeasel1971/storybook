**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Feature: Component Security Scanning
  Scenario: Automated vulnerability detection
    Given a component is developed or updated
    When the component enters the build pipeline
    Then automated security scanning is performed
    And vulnerabilities are detected and classified by severity
    And security reports are generated for review
    And high-severity vulnerabilities block deployment
```
