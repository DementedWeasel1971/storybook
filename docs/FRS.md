# Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) - Design System

This document provides the detailed technical specifications and Unified Modeling Language (UML) descriptions for the React Design System. It serves as the primary technical guide for implementation, complementing the functional requirements outlined in the [Requirements Document Specification (RDS)](./RDS.md).

This FRS is a core component of the Architect Crew methodology employed in this repository. It ensures that all technical implementations are based on a clearly defined and agreed-upon design.

## Technical Implementation Details

This section will house all Mermaid UML diagrams and other specific technical details that were previously located in `docs/RDS.md` or that are newly created. AI Agents (as per `AGENTS.md`) and human developers should refer to this document for the authoritative technical design.

Claude (as per `CLAUDE.md`) is responsible for ensuring this document is kept up-to-date with accurate technical specifications and that `AGENTS.md` correctly references this FRS for implementation guidance.
